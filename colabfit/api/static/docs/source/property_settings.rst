PropertySettings

It is best practice to attach a :class:`PropertySettings` object to a
:class:`~colabfit.tools.property.Property` instance in order to better document
the conditions under which the property was computed. This would often include
information such as the DFT software package, a description of the calculation,
and an example file for running the calculation.
